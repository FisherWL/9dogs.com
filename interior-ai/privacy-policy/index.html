        <p>
          This policy explains what information we collect when you use Interior Design AI, how we use it,
          and the choices you have. If you have questions or want to request deletion, email
          <a href="mailto:app@9dogs.com">app@9dogs.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h2>
        <h3>Information you provide</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Photos and images you choose to upload</b> (for example, room photos).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Text inputs and preferences</b> (for example, style/vibe selections and prompts).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Support messages</b> you send to us (for example, email content and attachments).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Device and app information</b> (such as device model, OS version, app version, language, and
            general region inferred from settings/IP address).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Diagnostics</b> (crash logs and performance data) to help us fix bugs and improve reliability (for example, via Sentry).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Usage data</b> (for example, which screens are visited and which features are used), in aggregated
            or de-identified form where possible (for example, via Amplitude).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Device identifiers</b> (for example, Android ID/SSAID or iOS IDFV) used to help prevent abuse
            (such as repeated promotional credit claims) and support account functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Purchases</h3>
        <p>
          If you purchase a subscription or other in-app products, the transaction is processed by the app store
          (Apple App Store or Google Play). We and our monetization provider may receive information such as
          your subscription status and purchase/entitlement events, but we do not receive your full payment card
          details from the store.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-we-use">How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and operate the App (including generating outputs from your inputs).</li>
          <li>Improve features, usability, and performance.</li>
          <li>Prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents.</li>
          <li>Communicate with you about support requests.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="sharing">Sharing</h2>
        <p>We share information only as needed to provide the App, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Infrastructure and storage</b> (for example, Supabase for authentication, database, and file storage).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>AI processing providers</b> used to analyze your inputs and generate outputs (for example, Google
            Gemini APIs). This may include sending uploaded images and related prompts to the provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Analytics and crash reporting</b> (for example, Amplitude and Sentry) to understand usage and improve stability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Purchases and subscriptions</b> (for example, RevenueCat to manage entitlements/credits, and the
            relevant app store for billing).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Legal and safety</b> when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with law or protect rights,
            safety, and integrity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Business transfers</b> if we’re involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale (you’ll be notified
            if required by law).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fine" style="margin-top: 10px;">

        <h2 id="ai-processing">AI processing</h2>
        <p>
          The App uses AI to analyze room photos and generate redesigned images and design specs. In practice this can
          involve:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Processing your uploaded images and prompts to produce outputs.</li>
          <li>Storing generated outputs (images and text) so you can view them later.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not intentionally use your content to train our own models. Our AI providers process data to provide the
          service; review their policies for details on their handling of data.
        </p>

        <h2 id="choices">Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Access and deletion requests:</b> You can contact us to request access to or deletion of personal
            information we may hold about you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Permissions:</b> You can control photo/library permissions in your device settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Uninstall:</b> You can stop most collection by uninstalling the App. Some information (such as purchase
            records) may remain with the app store and our providers as required for legal/compliance reasons.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="retention">Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain information only as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer
          retention period is required or permitted by law. For example, we may retain generated projects/outputs so
          you can access them again, and we may retain certain logs for security and debugging. We may retain
          de-identified or aggregated data longer.
        </p>

        <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information.
          No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2 id="children">Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the age defined by local law). We do not knowingly
          collect personal information from children. If you believe a child provided information, contact us and
          we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="international">International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          We and our service providers may process and store information on servers located outside of your country
          of residence. Data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above when we make
          changes. Material changes may be communicated in the App or by other means where appropriate.
        </p>
