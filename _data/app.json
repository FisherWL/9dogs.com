"description":"\"Eliminate confusion.\" This is our top priority when designing Unit Converter application.\n\nWe understand that this is a noisy world — those unit categories and unit abbreviations are already confusing enough. You need a high signal-to-noise ratio tool — this unit conversion tool is here to make your life easier.\n\nAs a normal user, at first we just want to find a unit converter that does its job: convert units. However, disappointed by the top 30 unit converters on the market, we decided to make one on my own. The problem is, none of the existing converters handle properly and simultaneously the conflicts of:\n\n- unit full name and unit abbreviation:\nMost of the unit converters on the market don’t show information such as kg is short for kilogram, oz is short for ounce,lbs is short for pounds. Even if some of them do show unit full name and unit abbreviation, they show it in an awful way.\n\n- user experience and advertising:\nSome of the existing unit converters have poor usability because of ads. One example is placing interstitial ads between unit category page and unit conversion page, this causes serious user experience issues, could even infuriate a user.\n\n- commonly used units and professionally used units.\nAll of the unit converters on the market are at one of the two extremes: they target either too much or too few unit categories. Some of them only include weight unit, length unit, temperature unit and volume unit, while some of them try to include everything: power unit, pressure unit, energy unit, force unit, torque unit, frequency unit, and the list goes on and on.\n\nMost of these unit converters have a complicated navigation system, a lot of times we got lost in their unit conversion process.\n\nWith our unit conversion tool, you can easily convert commonly used units such as cm to inches, kg to lbs (kilogram to pounds), ounces to gram, km/h to mph, Celsius to Fahrenheit (of course Fahrenheit to Celsius).\n\nThe unit calculator achieves this goal by:\n\n- exploiting scrollable lists to limit invalid information:\nIn this way, users don’t get the distraction of undesired units of measurement, for example, if you want to convert cm to inches (centimeter to inches), you only need to focus on centimeter and inch in two separated lists, no need to pay attention to invalid information such as meter to feet, or kilometer to miles; we can also take converting gram to oz (ounce) for example, in this case you don’t need to pay attention to converting kg to lbs (kilogram to pounds) or ton to lbs (tonne to pounds).\n\n- utilizing responsive buttons to react to user input:\nThese buttons show what the unit abbreviations are — for example kg is short for kilogram, lbs is short for pounds, cm is short for centimeter — when you click them, it will bring you to where it’s located in the scrollable list, it’s very responsive! Try it, you’ll love it!\n\n- applying a simple layout to navigate between screens.\n\nTo make the unit conversion tool easy to use, the unit categories are sorted by frequency of use, rather than alphabetical order. So weight units, length units, volume units and temperature units are ranked ahead of speed units, power units and pressure units.\n\nThis usability principle is also adopted in the unit converting equation — commonly used measure units are placed at more visible areas. So kilogram (kg), gram (g), oz (ounce) and lbs (pound) are ranked ahead of tonne (ton), milligram (mg) and oz t (troy ounce), thus you can convert kg to lbs, or g to oz easily; centimeter (cm), millimeter (mm), inches (in) and mile (mi) are ranked ahead of nautical mile (nmi) and nanometer (nm), thus you can convert cm to inches, or km to miles easily.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send emails to:\n\tapp@1m1000mm.com", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.7007700000000003370814738445915281772613525390625,
